If your theme is properly tagged, Google will be able to show the stars corresponding to the average rating of the products in its natural results which will also improve&nbsp;<b>your visibility, your click rate and your traffic.<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Our&nbsp;<b>\"Shop Product Reviews\"<\/b>&nbsp;module is much more than a simple review collection module. With its multiple features and options for displaying reviews, whether on product pages or list pages, through dedicated blocks or badges, our&nbsp;<b>\"Shop Product Reviews\"<\/b>&nbsp;module allows you&nbsp;<b>to reassure your customers, reduce shopping cart abandonment and increase your conversion rate.<\/b>&nbsp;According to a study, from the first review posted on a product, the conversion rate increases by 10%, then 30% after 50 reviews, and up to more than 44% with 200 reviews! So don't hesitate!<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>COLLECT REVIEWS ON YOUR PRODUCTS, YOUR SHOP OR BOTH!<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>The \"\"Shop Product Reviews\"\" module<\/b>&nbsp;allows you to activate&nbsp;<b>independently<\/b>&nbsp;the collection of product reviews and the collection of reviews on your store in general. For each review system, many options are available: activation of moderation, display of reviews only in the current language, activation of a voting system, display of a \"latest reviews\" block, etc...<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>The product ratings will be displayed as stars. You have the ability to customize the color of the stars to fit your theme as there are an infinite number of colors available.&nbsp;<b>A \"Verified Purchase\" badge<\/b>&nbsp;can be displayed next to the reviews that result from an order, to&nbsp;<b>further reinforce the confidence of future buyers.<\/b>&nbsp;The color of the badge is also fully customizable as well as its text.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Whether it is for product or shop reviews,&nbsp;<b>a system of precise scheduling of the sending of rating request e-mails is available.<\/b>&nbsp;You also have the possibility to send a reminder if your customer has not given a review following the first e-mail. The titles and texts of the e-mails&nbsp;<b>can be configured<\/b>&nbsp;directly through the module, for each language of your store.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>Product reviews<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Give the possibility to evaluate a product to all registered customers or only to customers who ordered the product. The latter option makes it possible to further increase the reliability of customer feedback on your products.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Enjoy flexible positioning on product pages: Display your reviews either in the footer or within a tab (if your theme supports page tabs), and decide where to position the average product rating. Also decide to display the average product rating on list pages.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Allow your visitors to filter the reviews by rating and sort them as they want. Show them the distribution of the number of reviews by rating and allow them to get a quick and global idea of the reviews on a product, by enabling the display of a \"battle\" block showing the best review and the most critical one opposite each other.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Also note that by implementing product reviews, the average rating can appear in Google's natural results as stars,&nbsp;<b>which will attract attention and increase your visibility.<\/b>&nbsp;Links that display a product rating have&nbsp;<b>a click-through rate (CTR) between 15 and 30% higher.<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>Shop reviews<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Why not also collect feedback from your customers about their overall shopping experience?&nbsp;<b>Activate shop reviews<\/b>&nbsp;and allow your customers to share their feelings about their experience on your site, the choice offered, the offers or even the ease of payment and delivery! This will strengthen the bond you have with them by showing them that you are listening to their needs and will contribute to&nbsp;<b>increase loyalty<\/b>.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Place the link to the shop review form wherever you want on your website: customer account, product pages, menu, ... The module also allows you to display a \"shop review\" badge with the average rating given by your customers to your store, on the pages of your site while choosing its position and color.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM CRITERIA<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Do you want to know what your customers think about particular points? Create your own rating criteria!&nbsp;<b>Whether it is for products or the store,<\/b>&nbsp;the module offers you the possibility to create personalized criteria. You decide how the criteria are worded and whether you want to reserve them for certain products or categories!<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Use the product rating criteria to ask your customers to rate specific characteristics of certain items in order to validate or not your choice of products or suppliers: fabric quality, price, fit of a garment, sturdiness etc... It is&nbsp;<b>a free<\/b>&nbsp;way to know the efficiency of your catalog and&nbsp;<b>a precious help<\/b>&nbsp;to make informed decisions about your products.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>As for the rating criteria for your shop in general, you also have the choice: navigation, site ergonomics, variety of products, clarity of descriptions, ease of payment, or even choice of delivery points! The feedback from your customers will allow you&nbsp;<b>to make the right choices and get a better customer satisfaction rate.<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>Not to mention the SEO benefit of the criteria!<\/b>&nbsp;If you guide customers by asking them to give feedback on specific topics through the rating criteria, your customers will tend to use specific keywords that will boost your SEO on certain queries.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO POST A REVIEW BY OFFERING THEM A VOUCHER<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Your customers sometimes need a little help! Encourage them to leave their opinion on the products they bought, or about your shop, by offering them a voucher in exchange! This will encourage them&nbsp;<b>to come back to place an order on your online store and will increase their loyalty.<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>Once your offer is configured within the module, it will be displayed in the rating invitation e-mails and also in the product or shop rating forms.<\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><b>RIGHT TO REPLY TO BAD REVIEWS<\/b><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div>It's never easy to receive negative reviews. However, it can be an excellent opportunity to show that you are listening to your customers. That's why we allow you to respond to a dissatisfied customer in order to try to understand their dissatisfaction and provide a solution. This will allow you to show them that you offer a quality service and that customer satisfaction is your priority. By seeing that you take the customer relationship to heart, there is a good chance that he will change his rating.<\/div>","tab":"front_office_features","version":"5.0.5","compatibility":{"from":"1.7.6.0","to":"8.1.2"},"nbRates":"340","product_type":"module","avgRate":"4.4","price":{"EUR":97.99,"USD":109.99,"GBP":89.99},"badges":[{"label":"PrestaShop's Favorite","img":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/themes\/prestastore\/img\/front\/sprites\/badges\/ps-selected.png"},{"label":"Partnerski Kreator Modu\u0142\u00f3w","img":"https:\/\/medias2.prestastore.com\/themes\/prestastore\/img\/front\/sprites\/badges\/module-editor.png"}],"cover":{"small":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/1553908-pprod\/shop-product-reviews-product-reviews-shop-reviews.jpg","big":"https:\/\/addons.prestashop.com\/1553908-pbig\/shop-product-reviews-product-reviews-shop-reviews.jpg"},"changeLog":{"4.0.0":["added a new litigation review system (send e-mail to the customer with merchant reply + display merchant reply on the front-office)","added full deleting ratings and reviews system (can delete a rating alone)","added \"add review\" manually system","added \"last reviews\" block","added \"all reviews \" page","added a new hook that allows to include automatically your reviews in the product-list.tpl","added again \"rich snippets product\" badge for theme without \"rich snippets\"tags","added again \"product reviews list\" for themes with tabs on the product page","changed the moderation interface (added details lines for each rating \/ review)","changed the customer review account (slider with purchased product without review + table of purchased products already reviewed)","changed the e-mails layout (responsive)","changed the option blocks of each module tab","changed the layout of the module on many front-office sections"],"4.0.1":["added the product's title + link in last reviews block","bug fix for themes with tabs on product pages (forgot to add \"div id\")","bug fix for rich snippets reviews in : home \/ category \/ brand pages => change 'average' tag into 'ratingValue' which is matching with aggregateRating schema.org tag","change the error message for language fields in the back-office","added new layout for last reviews block when the block is displayed in column or not"],"4.0.2":["bug fix for the review rich snippets category page error","bug fix for managing well products not purchased and displayed them in the slider and the reviews made on products not purchased","added display option for review stars in the product-list.tpl","added some texts as options for the reminder e-mails, like this there is no more issue about translations used when a multi-languages cron execution is made","added option to receive an e-mail as carbon copy of each reminder e-mail sent"],"4.0.3":["bug fix for themes without rich snippets product in the product page, befire it made an error with aggregate rating, we added a product object including the aggregate rating"],"4.0.4":["Added new feature as rating average rounding, get more precised average by 0,1 after the comma","Removed all inline css","rewrite the entire front module css","Bug fix for the size of the average in the product-review-block.tpl","Bug fix for the translation of \"sur\" that was written without the l smarty function in 3 template files around pagination feature","Bug fix for Jquery star rating minified plugin when the smart JS cache was activated, a \";\" was missing at the end"],"4.0.5":["Added shop_id restriction in getProductsByOrder for product_lang","Added default text for email, IT\/ES\/DE"],"4.0.6":["Bug fix for SQL injection on the product Id returned by the module with Tools::getValue('id_product') when the hook to count the number of rating is executed. intval() added on every single ID passed to a query",""],"3.2.9":["Bug fix for SQL injection on the product Id returned by the module with Tools::getValue('id_product') when the hook to count the number of rating is executed. intval() added on every single ID passed to a query"],"4.0.7":["Added a new feature to refresh the form on the matching button displayed previously in the module's back-office","Added a new option \"bootstrap tabs\" to display reviews block with tabs on the product pages","Bug fix for description drag and drop on FF38, JQuery UI version was too low, added the latest version to make it work","Bug fix for moderation tool interface with the JS object, need to move the include file header above the first div in the template"],"4.0.8":["Bug fix for customer reviews page on the default value to activate or not \"e-mail reminder feature\"","Added new test on the availability of each product imported during \"importing product comments from PS module\" action.

The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of <strong>a rise in the amount of orders<\/strong> with total <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>The module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br \/><br \/>The \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module offers <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br \/>In presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more<\/strong>.<br \/><br \/>Highly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really <strong>control the impact<\/strong> of delivery costs.<br \/>The second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the \u201cFree Delivery Manager\u201d module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!<br \/><br \/>This module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback.
